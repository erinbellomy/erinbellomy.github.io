  <h1>Validation </h1>

  <blockquote> Validation.. what a loaded term. To validate oneself means to acknowledge and accept ones thoughts, feelings, characteristics, and emotions. One must take those fundamental characteristics and see it as understandable. To not receive validation stimulates insecurity in your everyday actions.  I think that it is crucial to understand the right way to achieve validation. The most important and key type of validation is self-validation. I am a huge proponent of looking to <italic>oneself</italic> for approval and truly understanding yourself and how you work. Understanding yourself and recognizing why you are the way you are and why you chose the actions you do is fundamental to achieve confidence in your behaviors. The second type of validation is one from your peers. This seems to hold more importance among people than that of self-validation. We tend to care about what people think of us more than how we think of ourselves. External support is definitely important but it means nothing if you aren’t validated at the core.</blockquote>

<strong>Looking for validation in all the wrong places</strong>

<p>I am constantly seeing examples of people who are not very secure with themselves going out to a party or a bar and are automatically worried about finding a guy or a girl to fill a certain void. As soon as someone comes over to talk to them, I see a sense of relief and it isn’t until then that they are able to have fun for the rest of the night. It is as if they aren’t alive until they are acknowledged by someone that is  romantically interested in them. Relying on others to validate oneself is not a reliable source. <strong>That. Is. Bad.</strong> I can’t stress that enough. Instead of having fun and being with your close friends, you are stressing about finding a guy/girl to understand how good you are. That is no fun. It is important to understand that bar/party scenes are not the places to look for validation of oneself. Party scenes are strictly about having fun and being silly with friends that you love.

Usually these tenancies for approval come in stronger when alcohol is involved. I want to stress that when people are out, they are not aware that they can hold the key to your confidence for the night, so they are definitely not going to act that way. You can’t rely on people to have that role because that role can only fundamentally be done by YOU. Alcohol seems to do a good job in validating all of the negative thoughts you have about yourself. I would highly suggest to nix alcohol until you are you no longer vulnerable to these tenancies.</p>

<strong>Wrong places to find validation from others:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>  Parties/bars</li>
    <li>Relationships</li>
    <li>Only people romantically interested in you</li>
</ul>
<strong>Right places to find validation:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Yourself</li>
    <li>Family</li>
    <li>Friends</li>

<italic><strong>Challenge</strong></italic>: Take account of your actions in the last week and bring out the positives in everything you did. Then for a week, try writing yourself a love note everyday. This can hopefully put you in the right direction and you can begin to feel validated from yourself, rather than others :)
