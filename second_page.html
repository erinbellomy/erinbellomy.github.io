  <h1>To Be... Content </h1>
<p><blockquote>  So the other day while talking with my friends, we were trying to understand what makes a person truly content. By content, I mean truly happy with their life and the way everything is going with friends, family, school work, etc. We were going back and fourth wondering and talking about what would make us completely satisfied with our lives. We came up with some steps to take in order to be truly content with life.</blockquote></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Be healthy!</strong>: This includes making sure to exercise at least 4 times a week and eating healthy. It is easy to try to feel satisfied with the rest of your life when your foundation is solid. Knowing that you are being an active person and a healthy eater will give you a confidence that is hard to wipe off, trust me.</li>
    <li>Be <italic>KIND</italic>: Simply BE NICE to people! It is not that hard. Smile to strangers, help out friends, be honest. When you are the kindest version of yourself, people realize this and will treat you in the same respect. Being kind has so many pros:</li>
<ul>
    <li> People will genuinely <strong>LIKE</strong> you</li>
        <li>People will respect you</li>
        <li>People will trust you</li>
        <li>People won’t spend time talking about you because they won’t have anything to talk about ;)</li>
        <li>Promotes confidence</li>
        <li>Creates an optimistic attitude</li>
        <li>Adds a deeper meaning to your life</li>
        <li>Most importantly: It makes<bold> you</bold> feel good about yourself</li>
    </ul>

    <li><strong>Work hard</strong>: Put actual effort into everything that your involved in, whether it be school, work, sports, etc. Try your hardest at everything so at the end of the day you can actually say “well, I did my best”. Putting your best effort into things is extremely rewarding. It gives one a sense of accomplishment and confidence. Hard work is the only thing that gets results. Working hard builds a character that will benefit you for the rest of your life. A hard work ethic isn’t easy to acquire, but once you succeed this type of mentality, it is with you for a life-time and will create so many opportunities in your lifetime.</li>
    <li><strong>Live in the present</strong>: Embrace the present. Live life day by day. Be present in TODAY. Don’t spend your days worrying about the future, or the past. Embrace the day you were blessed with today and make it the best you can. Don’t dwell on the past, this puts you at a stand still leaving you unable to build upon yourself now. Take the mistakes that you make in the past and learn from them and have them benefit your future.</li>
    <li><strong>Be thankful</strong: Take the time at the end of everyday and go through everything that you are thankful for in your life! Don’t spend time thinking about things that you don’t have or wish you had. Take this time and appreciate the people in your life and the relationships that you have in which you consider special and meaningful.</li>
</ol>
<p>I <italic>truly</italic> think that if all of these things are being done within your days, you will truly be content with your life. Treat each day with respect and love and it will treat you with love and respect. If one is healthy, kind, a hard worker, lives in the present and is thankful for what he/she has, life gets less complicated and more simplistic. Things can begin to fall into place and leave you being content and satisfied to live a beautiful life of a 20 something.</p>
