  <h1>My Philosphy </h1>
  <p>Welcome to my page! Okay so hear me out. I have this philosophy. <strong>DON’T STRESS.</strong> People, in my opinion, should live life everyday to their fullest abilities and live like they are rock stars. Easier said then done right? Have no fear- I have 20 years of knowledge on how to not stress. It is so important to live a happy, stress-free and peaceful lifestyle. It is easy to slip into the stress-zone, but don’t surrender to such nonsense. Simply channel different inspirations that help you see what is really important to you in life and that helps you feel like Beyoncé everyday. Constantly incorporate positive elements into your day so you are not surrounded by thoughts filled with negativity.

My goal is to share with you things that inspire me to get the most out of life everyday. My inspirations are things such as Beyoncé (obviously), music, fitness, and fashion. These inspirations  help me celebrate life in a positive manner and honestly really help me build my confidence. I hope by sharing these inspirations, that it can possibly inspire you to create or maintain a stress-free, HAPPY, and peaceful lifestyle! I will be giving tips on how to keep a sane mind in the midst of all potential stress of college, work, or anything else that stresses you out.

If you will join me, my blog is dedicated to help girls and guys to feel comfortable in their own skin and to avoid stress. I’m hoping that when people are done reading my blog they will feel that it is easier to celebrate life and to feel like a rock star everyday!</p>
